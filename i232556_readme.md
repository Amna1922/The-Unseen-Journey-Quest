## Dependencies

- ncurses: Used to handle terminal input and output, such as rendering the maze and managing player movement.
- g++: The game is written in C++ and requires a C++ compiler to build.
- Ubuntu/Debian: The game has been tested on Ubuntu/Debian systems.

## Configuration

- The game configuration such as grid size, number of undo moves, and player moves are determined by the selected difficulty level by modifying the `grid` variable:

  - Easy: 10x10 grid, 6 moves, 6 undo moves
  - Medium: 15x15 grid, 4 moves, 4 undo moves
  - Hard: 20x20 grid, 1 move, 1 undo move

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues during compilation or execution, ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed and
- ncurses errors: If the game fails to run and mentions missing ncurses libraries, ensure that ncurses is installed properly.
- Invalid input: If you enter an invalid level at the start, you'll be asked to select again.
